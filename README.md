# EasyGrow

EasyGrow is a fake e-commerce website designed to feel like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). It allows you to create an account, place and remove items in your cart, and use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to purchase the products (repeatedly press 424242... until the payment details are filled).

Check it out [here](https://easygrow-3e160.web.app/)!


### Motivation
------------------
I created this project to practice creating a user interface that will feel familiar and comfortable for users. It also gave me the opportunity to work on the back-end side of a web application.


### Technology Used
------------------
Resources:
[React JS](https://reactjs.org/),
[Material UI Framework](https://material-ui.com/),
[Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js),

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

# EasyGrow

EasyGrow is a fake e-commerce website designed to feel like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). It allows you to create an account, place and remove items in your cart, and use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to purchase the products (repeatedly press 424242... until the payment details are filled).

### Motivation

I created this project to practice creating a user interface that will feel familiar and comfortable for users. It also gave me the opportunity to work on the back-end side of a web application.

[Material UI Framework](https://material-ui.com/),
[Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js),
